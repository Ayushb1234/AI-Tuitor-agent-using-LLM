#🚀 AI Tutor System

A smarter way to learn — powered by NLP, LLMs, multi-language voice interaction, and adaptive topic simplification.

#📌 Overview

AI Tutor System is an intelligent learning assistant that transforms raw documents (PDFs, text files, or notes) into easy-to-understand, structured learning content.

The system extracts text → generates chapter-wise sections → simplifies content using an LLM → explains concepts interactively using a whiteboard-based React UI with voice-enabled explanation, refinement learning, and multi-language support.

It’s basically ChatGPT meets Khan Academy vibes 👇
📄 → 🧠 AI Understanding → 🎯 Simplified Lessons → 🗣 Interactive Learning
